# 10-Hour-Project

This is a game of lasers and rocks! You are Hiro and have to 
defend the universe and defeat the Mothership.
It will be coded by Emmnuel Luna, maker of the game.
The controls will be very simple. You move to where your mouse goes
and click to shoot your energy shots.
Make sure to be careful yo not get close to the mothership, 
or you will have a painfull death.
